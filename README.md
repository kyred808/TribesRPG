**Custom models are currently used and more will be used moving forward.  The default trpg install won't work**

Extract baseline into a folder.  Delete scripts.vol and the MISSIONS folder inside the RPG folder.  From this repo, add missions and scripts folder to your RPG folder.

In your tribes folder, create a shortcut to Tribes.exe.  Right click and go to Properties.  In the Target: line, add -mod RPG to the end.  Run Tribes using this shortcut.

**Be sure to modify admin_defs.cs to not include me "Kyred" as admin.  Unless you want to.**
